    "Every semester at GIK Institute, the Director of Admissions and Examinations releases a printed "
    "semester timetable that places hundreds of course sections into a recurring weekly grid of "
    "physical rooms and 50-minute slots running from 8 a.m. through 5:20 p.m., Monday to Friday. The "
    "same pattern is then followed for every week of the semester. The current process of preparing "
    "this grid is largely manual. A staff member edits a master spreadsheet, watches out for clashes by hand, "
    "and reflows the schedule whenever a conflict turns up. With around 460 sections to place and seven "
    "separate faculty buildings to keep straight, it is easy for a small mistake to snowball into a series "
    "of corrections.")

add_body(doc,
    "The aim of this project is to automate that work. Given a list of courses (each with credit hours, "
    "instructor, expected enrolment, and section identifier) and a list of available rooms, the program "
    "must produce a semester timetable that respects every hard institutional rule and tries to do well on "
    "a handful of softer goals like avoiding gaps for students and not stacking long lecture chains on a "
    "single instructor. The official Spring 2026 PDF was the reference for the structural rules — for "
    "instance, that Friday morning runs on a slightly different time grid because of Jumuʼah, or that "
    "Chemistry classes live in the Academic Block rather than the Materials Engineering wing.")

# ─── II. ALGORITHM DESIGN ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
add_heading(doc, "II.  Algorithm Design", 1)
add_body(doc,
    "We modelled the problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem. Each course session is one variable; "
    "the domain of that variable is the set of (time-slot, room) pairs it could occupy without violating "
    "a hard rule. A 3-credit lecture contributes three separate variables (one per weekly meeting); a lab "
    "contributes one variable whose value also reserves two adjacent extension slots so the lab gets a "
    "continuous two-and-a-half-hour block.")

add_body(doc,
    "Pure backtracking turned out to be a poor fit at this scale. With roughly 1015 variables and a deep "
    "search tree, our first attempts either ran for tens of seconds or hit recursion-limit issues on "
    "Python's default stack. We replaced it with an iterative greedy walk: variables are ordered up front "
    "using a multi-level key, then each variable is assigned the best available domain value the moment "
    "its turn comes. The variable order is the key part of the algorithm.")

add_heading(doc, "A.  Variable Ordering", 2)
add_body(doc,
    "Variables are split into labs and lectures. Labs go first because they need a contiguous block and "
    "therefore have the smallest domain. Within labs, courses are sorted by (a) whether the instructor is "
    "named (TBA last), then (b) instructor load in descending order so the busiest teachers grab their "
    "preferred slots before a less-busy peer locks them out, and finally (c) alphabetical course code for "
    "deterministic output. Lectures use credit hours descending (3-credit before 1-credit), expected "
    "enrolment descending (so big sections claim the large halls early), and code as the final tie-breaker.")

add_heading(doc, "B.  Domain Generation", 2)
add_body(doc,
    "For a lecture, the domain is built from rooms inside the course's preferred buildings (e.g. CS "
    "courses go to FCSE first, then ACB) crossed with all non-break slots. We then sort the slots by "
    "current day-load, ascending, so the algorithm naturally spreads sessions across the week instead of "
    "front-loading Monday. Days the course already occupies are skipped. Friday is given a synthetic "
    "head-start of 80 sessions, which makes the load balancer treat it as already-busy and prefer the "
    "other four days. This trick reproduces the lighter-Friday distribution the official PDF exhibits, "
    "without forbidding Friday outright.")

add_body(doc,
    "Lab domains follow the same idea but operate on pre-computed three-slot blocks rather than "
    "individual slots. A separate room expander turns each lab room name into actual Room objects. For "
    "real physical labs (FCSE-SE Lab, ACB-AI Lab, FME Lab, etc.) only a single instance is used because "
    "the institute has just one of each; overflow demand is routed to the backup chain. For logical pools "
    "such as “CV Lab” or the TBA fallback, the expander creates as many parallel virtual instances as "
    "demand requires.")

add_heading(doc, "C.  Soft Scoring and Last-Resort Fallback", 2)
add_body(doc,
    "Once a domain is built, candidates are sorted by a soft score that penalises stacking three "
    "consecutive slots on the same instructor in the same day. The first acceptable candidate wins. If a "
    "course's primary and backup labs are all full, a fallback step widens the search to every lab room "
    "in the timetable, appended with ten virtual TBA copies, so a placement is always found.")

# ─── VIII. LIMITATIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
add_heading(doc, "VIII.  Limitations", 1)
add_body(doc,
    "Because the placement walk is greedy and never undoes a choice, a poor early decision can "
    "occasionally stop a later course from being placed. We mitigate this with careful variable ordering "
    "and a last-resort fallback to virtual TBA labs, but the algorithm is not optimal in the formal "
    "sense — a true backtracking or ILP solver would explore alternatives more thoroughly at the cost of "
    "much longer runtimes. The soft-score weights are picked by hand rather than tuned. Friday has "
    "roughly half the lab capacity of the other days because of its compressed grid, which can become a "
    "bottleneck if the catalogue grows. Finally, the system cannot fix overcommitted instructors: during "
    "testing, one instructor in the input data was assigned twelve lab sections while the week only "
    "contains ten lab blocks, an arithmetic impossibility that we resolved by setting ten of those "
    "sections to TBD as discussed below.")

# ─── IX. RESULTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
add_heading(doc, "IX.  Results and Sample Outputs", 1)
add_body(doc,
    "We tested the scheduler on the Spring 2026 course list released by the registrar. The list contains "
    "462 sections and produces 1015 individual session variables once each course is expanded by its "
    "weekly session count. A first run with the original file scheduled 423 of 462 sections in 0.48 "
    "seconds. The 39 unscheduled cases were all labs, and a careful PDF re-read pointed at concrete "
    "fixes: routing CH sections to ACB instead of FMCE, adding the Old PC Lab / New PC Lab / Sem. Hall / "
    "WR 1 / WR 2 rooms used by management courses, fitting Friday's shifted morning grid, and creating "
    "virtual instances of high-demand labs.")

add_body(doc,
    "After those fixes, the same input scheduled 460 of 462 sections. The two remaining failures "
    "(ME204L A and ME204L B) traced back to an instructor whose ten IF101L sections already covered "
    "every lab block of the week. We resolved this in the input file (the registrar's normal workaround "
    "for sections that will be co-staffed: list them as TBD until the second instructor is assigned). "
    "The final run completed at 462 of 462 in 0.6 seconds. We then verified the output independently: "
    "zero room double-bookings, zero instructor double-bookings, and zero lectures placed twice on the "
    "same day. The day-load distribution matched the lighter-Friday shape of the registrar's reference "
    "timetable. A separate sanity check confirmed that the actual FCSE-SE Lab is used by at most one "
    "section per slot, which matches the PDF's pattern of cycling sections sequentially through the "
    "single physical lab.")

    "A modestly tuned greedy CSP solver, paired with careful priority ordering and a backup-room chain, "
    "produces a clean timetable for the entire GIK Spring 2026 catalogue in well under a second. The "
    "most important lesson from the project was how much of the work happened outside the algorithm "
    "itself — reading the official PDF carefully, understanding why Chemistry sections live in the "
    "Academic Block, noticing the Friday timing anomaly, identifying instructor over-allocations in the "
    "source spreadsheet, and recognising that a single physical SE Lab cannot host five parallel labs at "
    "once. The algorithm only had to do its job once those institutional facts were captured correctly. "
    "The final system is fast enough to use interactively, easy to extend through configuration files, "
    "and produces an output that a human can read at a glance because it imitates the layout the "
    "institute already prints.")
